# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI-Native Impact Tree for Product Strategy & Execution

### Executive Summary

The AI-Native Impact Tree is a dynamic, continuously evolving product management tool designed for Product Managers who practice continuous discovery. Built as a live document that grows with learning, the tool combines OKR methodology with impact mapping and user story mapping techniques, enhanced by AI-powered insights to help PMs discover their path to product-market fit.

### Problem Statement

Product Managers practicing continuous discovery struggle with:
- Maintaining a live, evolving view of their product strategy as they learn
- Visualizing complex hierarchical relationships between jobs-to-be-done, milestones, and granular opportunities
- Connecting high-level strategic outcomes to detailed execution steps
- Tracking assumptions and learnings across multiple discovery cycles
- Adapting their strategy tree as customer insights emerge
- Finding the right level of granularity for solutions based on opportunity scope

### Solution Overview

A continuously evolving, AI-enhanced impact tree that grows with PM learning:
1. **Live Document Approach**: Tree structure that adapts and evolves through continuous discovery
2. **Hierarchical Branching**: Multi-level outcomes for different teams and cascading opportunities from jobs-to-be-done to steps
3. **Variable Solution Granularity**: Solutions that scale from broad (job-level) to granular (step-level) based on opportunity scope
4. **Continuous Discovery Integration**: Built-in research and assumption tracking for ongoing learning
5. **AI-Powered Insights**: Contextual suggestions that adapt to the PM's discovery journey

### Product Philosophy: Continuous Discovery & Iterative Development

**Core Principles:**
- **Learning Over Planning**: The tree evolves based on customer insights, not predetermined roadmaps
- **Small Steps, Big Impact**: Start simple, iterate based on real usage and feedback
- **Discovery-Driven**: Every feature supports the continuous discovery process
- **Open Source Foundation**: Community-driven development with sustainable monetization
- **Product-Market Fit Focus**: Every iteration moves toward better user-problem fit
