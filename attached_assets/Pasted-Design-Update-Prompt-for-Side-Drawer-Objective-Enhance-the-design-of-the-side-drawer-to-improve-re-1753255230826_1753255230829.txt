Design Update Prompt for Side Drawer
Objective: Enhance the design of the side drawer to improve readability, usability, and visual appeal while adhering to accessibility standards.

Typography Adjustments:
Font Typography, Weight, and Color:
Adjust the font family to a more readable typeface.
Increase the font weight for both placeholder texts and filled-in texts to enhance visibility.
Implement a color palette that improves contrast between text and background, focusing on:
Placeholder texts should be a lighter color (e.g., gray) to indicate they are not real text.
Filled text should be darker for better readability.
Differentiate each section of the side drawer:
Use changes in size, weight, and color to create a clear visual hierarchy.
Ensure spacing between sections is adequate to allow easy navigation.
General UI Improvements:
Opening/Closing Animation:

Update the animation for the drawer so that when it opens, the gray space is not visible during the transition. Consider using a fade-in effect or making the drawer slide in smoothly without the gray background being displayed.
Hover States:

Implement subtle background color changes on menu items or interactive elements upon hover.
Change the text/icon color slightly to match the accent color, avoiding strong shadows or glow effects.
Active States:

Clearly highlight the currently selected menu item with a distinct background color and/or text color that is still subtle, ensuring it integrates well with the rest of the design.
Scrollbars:

Style custom scrollbars to be thin and minimally intrusive, matching the overall aesthetic of the drawer.
Accessibility Considerations:
Accessibility Checklist:
Ensure all color contrasts meet WCAG guidelines for readability.
Implement clear focus states for all interactive elements.
Include ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance screen reader support.
Note: Please ensure that no logic or existing templates are altered during this design update.
