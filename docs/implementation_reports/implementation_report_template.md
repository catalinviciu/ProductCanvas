3. **Database Design**: JSONB storage in PostgreSQL handled complex tree structures efficiently
4. **Discovery Integration**: Features naturally supported PM continuous discovery practices

### **Challenges Faced**
1. **Large Tree Performance**: Trees with 200+ nodes required virtualization implementation
2. **State Synchronization**: Keeping canvas state and server state synchronized required careful design
3. **AI Integration Complexity**: Vertex AI prompt engineering for discovery insights took iteration
4. **PM Workflow Understanding**: Required deep understanding of continuous discovery practices

### **Improvements for Next Time**
