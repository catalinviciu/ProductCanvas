## 🔍 **Analysis Execution Instructions**

### **Phase 1: Core Architecture (Priority 1)**
```bash
# Focus on these critical areas first:
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/         # React component organization
│   ├── services/          # API service layer
│   ├── store/             # State management
│   ├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   └── App.js/tsx         # Main application component

backend/
├── server/
│   ├── routes/            # REST API routes
