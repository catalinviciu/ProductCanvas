## 🎓 **Developer Learning Guide**

### **📚 Concept Overview**
[Explain the feature in context of Product Management continuous discovery practices]

This feature supports Product Managers who practice continuous discovery by [explain how it fits into the discovery workflow]. The AI-Native Impact Tree serves as a live document that evolves with PM learning, connecting OKR methodology with impact mapping and user story mapping techniques.

### **🏗️ Architecture Diagram**
```mermaid

    A[React Canvas Component] --> B[Tree State Manager]
    B --> C[Express API Endpoint]
    C --> D[Drizzle ORM Service]
    D --> E[PostgreSQL Database]
    
    F[Vertex AI Service] --> C
    G[Discovery Workflow] --> A
    H[PM User Interaction] --> A
```

### **🔄 Implementation Flow**
1. **Canvas Interaction**: PM interacts with impact tree nodes on HTML5 canvas
2. **State Management**: Zustand updates tree state and triggers re-renders
3. **API Persistence**: TanStack Query syncs changes to Express backend
4. **AI Enhancement**: Vertex AI provides discovery insights based on tree context

### **⚠️ Common Pitfalls**
- **Canvas Performance**: Large trees can slow down rendering - use virtualization
- **State Synchronization**: Keep canvas state and server state in sync
- **AI Integration**: Handle Vertex AI rate limits and token costs
- **Discovery Context**: Ensure features support continuous discovery practices

### **🔗 Learning Resources**
- **React Canvas**: HTML5 canvas with React best practices
- **Impact Mapping**: Teresa Torres continuous discovery methodology
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe PostgreSQL operations
- **Vertex AI**: Google Cloud AI integration patterns

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**
- Impact trees are live documents that evolve with PM discovery
- Canvas performance is critical for user experience with large trees
- AI integration should enhance discovery workflows, not replace PM judgment
- All features should support the continuous discovery mindset
