## üéØ **Business Case**

### **Problem Statement**
Product Managers practicing continuous discovery need to visually compare and prioritize Opportunities and Solutions based on their ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) scores. Currently, these scores are only visible within the detailed node editing interface, making it difficult to perform quick visual comparisons and stack ranking across multiple nodes on the canvas.

### **User Story**
**As a** Product Manager practicing continuous discovery  
**I want** to see ICE scores on Opportunity cards and RICE scores on Solution cards as persistent visual badges  
**So that** I can quickly compare and stack rank opportunities and solutions without opening detailed editing interfaces

### **Priority & Impact**
- **Priority**: 
  - [x] ‚≠ê **High** (Important for discovery workflow)
  - [ ] üî• **Critical** (Blocking product-market fit discovery)
  - [ ] üìã **Medium** (Nice to have for PM productivity)
  - [ ] üìù **Low** (Future consideration)

- **Impact**: 
  - [x] üìä **Medium** (Improves discovery experience)
  - [ ] üéØ **High** (Core discovery functionality, affects all PMs)
  - [ ] üîß **Low** (Internal improvement)

## üìù **Detailed Requirements**

### **Frontend Requirements (React + TypeScript)**
1. **Score Badge Component**: New ScoreBadge component that displays ICE/RICE scores with consistent styling
2. **Node Integration**: Integrate badges into existing TreeNode component rendering
3. **Real-time Updates**: Update badges when scores change in the editing drawer
4. **Conditional Display**: Show badges only when scores exist (all required fields completed)
5. **Visual Design**: Sleek, non-intrusive badge that doesn't overpower node title

### **Backend Requirements (Node.js + Express)**
1. **Score Calculation Service**: Calculate ICE and RICE scores using existing frontend formulas
2. **Score Persistence**: Store calculated scores in database for consistent display
3. **Bulk Score Updates**: Update scores efficiently during bulk node operations
4. **Score Validation**: Validate score inputs and handle edge cases
5. **Performance**: Optimize score calculations for large trees

### **Database Requirements**
1. **Score Storage**: Extend templateData JSONB to include calculated scores
2. **Score Fields**: Add iceScore and riceScore fields to node template data
3. **Migration Strategy**: Update existing nodes to calculate and store scores
4. **Indexing**: No additional indexes needed (scores stored in existing JSONB)

### **Canvas Integration Requirements**
1. **Badge Positioning**: Position badges on bottom-left of node cards
2. **Canvas Performance**: Ensure badge rendering doesn't impact canvas performance
3. **Zoom Compatibility**: Badges scale appropriately with canvas zoom levels
4. **Selection States**: Badges remain visible when nodes are not selected, during node selection and hover states

## üéì **Developer Learning Guide**

### **üìö Concept Overview**
This feature implements visual scoring badges that display calculated ICE and RICE scores directly on tree node cards. ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) scoring is used for Opportunity nodes to help PMs prioritize which opportunities to pursue. RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) scoring is used for Solution nodes to help PMs prioritize which solutions to implement.

The badges provide immediate visual feedback for prioritization decisions without requiring PMs to open detailed editing interfaces. This supports the continuous discovery workflow by enabling quick comparison and stack ranking of opportunities and solutions.

    G[Node Template Data] --> B
    H[Real-time Updates] --> E
    I[Canvas Performance] --> F
```

### **üîÑ Implementation Flow**
1. **Score Input**: PM enters ICE/RICE values in node editing drawer
2. **Calculation**: Backend service calculates final scores using established formulas
3. **Persistence**: Calculated scores stored in database templateData
4. **Display**: ScoreBadge component renders scores on canvas nodes
5. **Updates**: Real-time updates when scores change through optimistic updates

### **üìä Scoring Formulas**
**ICE Score Calculation:**
```typescript
// ICE Score = (Impact x Confidence x Ease) 
const iceScore = (iceImpact * iceConfidence * iceEase);
```

**RICE Score Calculation:**
```typescript
// RICE Score = (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort
const riceScore = (riceReach * riceImpact * riceConfidence) / riceEffort;
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls**
- **Score Calculation Consistency**: Ensure backend calculations match frontend formulas exactly
- **Badge Positioning**: Position badges to avoid overlapping with node titles or other elements
- **Canvas Performance**: Multiple badges on large trees can impact rendering performance
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep displayed scores in sync with actual template data
- **Edge Cases**: Handle division by zero in RICE calculations and incomplete score data

### **üîó Learning Resources**
- **ICE Scoring Methodology**: Product management prioritization framework
- **RICE Scoring Framework**: Intercom's prioritization framework
- **Canvas Performance**: HTML5 canvas optimization techniques
- **React Component Design**: Best practices for reusable components

### **üéØ Key Takeaways**
- Score badges provide immediate visual feedback for PM prioritization decisions
- Consistent score calculation between frontend and backend is critical
- Canvas performance must be maintained even with multiple badges
- Conditional display ensures badges only appear when scores are meaningful
- Real-time updates enhance the discovery workflow by providing immediate feedback
